By now, you've heard of hybrid apps and the ease of development they bring to web developers who want to create mobile apps. Navigating your way from app creation to the user's hands can be a rather lengthy process for any developer, new or veteran. 

Ionic gives you tools to use with web technologies you already know and love, giving you a happy path to take from concept to completion.

In this talk, we will discuss what makes an app hybrid, what challenges you will face when building a hybrid app, and how Ionic helps you jump over these challenges. We will jump head-first into components in Ionic that harness Angular. We will also cover our roadmap from Ionic v1 with Angular v1, to Ionic v2 with Angular v2.
